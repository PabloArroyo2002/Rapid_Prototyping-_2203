 ## Mid Review Recap
 
 ### Collectors
  We reviewed and presented a number of ways in which we can concentrate solar energy. The most simple method would likely be to purchase a fresnel
  lense. The advantage of a Fresnel lens is that we would not have to do much besides build a frame to hold it steady and the fact that the focal
  point is on the opposit of the light source means that we need no holes or mirrors to direct the sunlight into the tube that brings down sunlight.
  Another benefit of the Fresnel lens is that it would serve as an umbrella for the tube, preventing rain from getting in. The Fresnel lens does have 
  two downsides: that it has a very textured surface and may be hard to clean as a result, and that it has a low maximum efficiency of around 82%.
  
  Next in terms of ease of manufacture is the collector made out of many small mirrors, each attached to a backing board at the right angle
  to gather all the light into the focal point. The advantage of this method is that most of manufacturing would be done by a CNC cutting into foam or
  wood, and would only require us to program the angles of each small part of the surface and then for us to carefully glue each mirror on to the surface.
  A slight variation of this would be to cut out parts of a parabola with a laser cutter so that the edges line up. For this we would probably glue mylar
  onto the cut out pieces of acrylic.
  
  Producing a spherical approximation of a parabolic mirror would likely be a fast, albeit complicated way of making the collector. We would begin by cutting
  a hole in a piece of smooth PVC board that is about 36"x36" and then marking a circle with an 18" radius around the center hole. In the central hole we 
  would glue in a Schrader bike valve and then connect it to a bike pump. Next, we would put epoxy along the outside of the circle that we marked on the board,
  and would then draw a piece of emergecy blanket over the circle of epoxy, to seal it to the board. Once the epoxy cures, we could then pressurize the mylar
  with the bike pump, and could then proceed to lay on 3-5 layers of fiberglass (or potentially 
  [***burlap***](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.14/people/tim_fallon/project-09.html))
  on the back of the now curved mylar, adding a circular reinforcement around the rim to ensure rigidity. 
  
  Both the modular and one piece mirror collectors would require a second, higher quality reflector, as pointed out during out the Mid-Review, and for this
  a commercial convex mirror could be modified by removing the protective paint on the back with airplane paint remover. Our audience for the Mid-Review was
  also helpful in pointing out to us that we should incorporate a fine adjuster for the secondary reflector since our first surface may not be aligned exactly
  as we intend it to be.
  
  One idea resuscitated by our audience was that of the parabolic trough, particularly its benefits as it only needs to track along one axis. Were it not for
  the problem of moving all the light down to the battery, this would have been one of the most promising designs as it requires simple curves, rather than
  compound curves.
  
 ### Tracking
  
  Although we did not recieve many comments on tracking, besides the fact that it may be possible to track the sun manually if one does not desire
  to leave the collector unattended for safety reasons. 
  
  We exhibited the possibility of using NOAA data to guide the turret that will aim the mirror at the sun with no inputs. The other possibilities we presented
  were using photo-resistors or solar panels to guide the motors, directly or through a microprocessor. The benefit of photo-resistors is that the code has
  already been written, the benefit of solar panels is that it would diminish the requirement for drawing power from a battery. Both methods would need some
  sort of external controller or clever engineering to have them adjust themselves towards the sun every morning.
  
 ### General Integration
  
  Dealing with rain is the biggest integration problem that we had not yet considered. We had considered wind, since it is not uncommon for the sun to shine
  while the wind blows. While we found that diminishing the size of the collector could solve the problem of wind, it seems that we will likely need to add
  a clear piece of glass to the center of the collecting dish to keep out water. Furthermore, we will need to come up with a way of preventing condensation
  from building up in the mirrored tube, as this would ruin its efficacy. A drain at the bottom of the mirrored tube would likely help water from 
  accumulating over time. Another approach is to design the mirrored tube so that manageable parts can be removed and cleaned with relative ease, which 
  would not be the case for removing the whole tube at once.
  
  Producing the mirrored tube...
  
 ## Design
  
I have been working on views from each side of the collector so that I can lay them down on cardboard and cut them out to make a scale model.
this is currently a work in progress so for now I present 
  
 ##Research:
    As shown on the two sun altitude path charts, most of the intense sunlight (sufficient UVB for vitamin D production is used as an analog) is
  accessible when the sun is close to directly overhead. The angles we need to access and the depth of the collector will play a large role in determining
  the height of the final assembly, as we need clearance between the top of the cooking space and the collector. For a spherical approximation of the
  collector's geometry, we find that the focal radius is approximately (D^2+10,000)/(2D), where D is the depth (in cm) of the collector, assuming a radius of
  100cm.
