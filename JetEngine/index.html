  I wrapped the 3D printed molds for the burn chamber in cling wrap to make it easier to separate from the carbon fiber that would surround it, as I had not mold
  release that I knew would withstand the caustic sealant.

  I used a Bridgeport mill to produce 6 and 12 faces on these pieces of stainless steel pipe and I then drilled out 1/64" and 1/32" holes, using the mill
  as a drill press. I began by machining the faces down as deep as I could to make it easier to drill the holes. The various numbers of holes and sizes
  allows me the possibility of testing different ways of injecting the propane into the burn chamber.

  The idea behind the stainless steel mesh is to further slow the propane, which as I learned in liquid prop rocketry presentations, is much better than
  having high speed motion at the site of combustion, as that leads to flame instabilities.

  This is an earlier fuel injector I made with an angle grinder and a drill press with a larger bit than the ones used on the mill.

  The propane was burning very fuel rich as it was not in the engine and therefore created a lot of soot. This is an earlier test with the two pieces
  of carbon fiber at either end spreading out the propane.

  This is the lid, fuel injector and flame tube holder for the Mk II version of the burn chamber.
  The holes in the flame tube holder allow air to enter the flame tube despite the fact that it is being held in place.

  In an attempt to protect the turbocharger blades from debris in the burn chamber, I added this stainless steel mesh;
  however, this was probably more harmful than helpful as it slowed the airflow and the steel mesh itself broke.

  Here is a picture of the Mk II burn chamber mounted onto the turbocharger before I had a blast shield and the cooling
  system installed.

  The fuel injector reached about 300 degrees when the propane was burning in open air.

  Here I made a design that I would cut out of sheet metal with a hand drill and tin snips. The purpose of this piece
  is to prevent the turbocharger from swaying as the thrust of the engine ramps up. This was one of the hardest pieces to make
  after the burn chamber and the lid for the oil reservoir. The holes of 3/8" diameter allow a hose clamp to tighten around the 
  front of the turbocharger.

  Here you can see the flame tube, lid and flame tube holder next to the Mk II burn chamber, which is attached to the turbocharger.
  Also visible is the mess on my garage floor.

  Mk II burn chamber is securely fastened down and attached to the turbocharger, all of which is mounted onto the steel frame I welded.
  On the bottom of the cart are caster wheels and then there are multiple layers of wood that hold the pumps, reservoirs and electronics
  needed to cool and run the engine and sparkplug. The large aluminum radiator is for water and the smaller black one is for oil, and I 
  suspect that it has a small leak. The top steel sheet is bolted onto the frame through 24 holes I painstakingly drilled into the top pf
  the frame. Also visible are the boost and oil pressure gauges. An important rule is to keep oil pressure greater than boost as otherwise
  the air pressure will blow the oil out of the seals and bearings in the turbo casing.

  Before I explain what is being displayed here, let us take a moment to appreciate the chaos that is the background of this image. The object
  of my depiction is the PLA 3d printed mold for the new burn chamber, one that can be disassembled and reassembled to test different locations
  for adding air to the burn chamber. The molds still need to be sanded, coated in polyurethane and wrapped to make removal from the carbon fiber
  parts easier.

  Finally, you can see Mk III fully mounted onto the test stand and turbocharger. As you can see, the burn chamber, unlike Mk II which was made
  in one piece, is made of various parts with easy to access nuts and bolts holding the parts and lid together. Visible on either end of the turbocharger
  are pieces of sheetmetal I cut and folded to provide structural stability.
