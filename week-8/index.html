 ## Mastic Tape Trial #1
  To avoid cutting a hole in a table or a large piece of board, we experimented with placing down a rough circle of 3M mastic tape on a
  countertop. We cleaned the table with water and then hand sanitizer so that the tape could stick directly to a clean surface.
  We traced a 700c bicycle wheel as our guide. We left a small gap in the tape so we could insert a piece of 
  pneumatic tubing and then added tape on the sides and on top to ensure a proper seal with the mylar. With the pneumatic tape now secure
  we used a heat gun to soften the end that was outside the circle and then inserted a (presta) bicycle valve into the end, so that as the 
  tube cooled it would shrink tightly onto to the bicycle valve. 
  
  With the preparation complete, we stretched out the piece of pylar and laid it onto the circle and pressed it onto the tape firmly. To our
  surprise, the reflective layer of the mylar  had largely come off the thin film and was getting onto our fingers. Most of the mylar blankets we had seemed to have a
  similar degradation issue, so we sorted out the best one and kept it separate for use on the final model. Once the mylar was convincingly 
  secured to the mastic tape, we connected a bike pump to the presta valve and began inflating the mylar bubble. There was a bit of leaking but 
  it was not enough to prevent the mylar from staying relatively inflated. Most of the leaking was coming from the area where we inserted the 
  pneumatic tubing into the mastic tape, so that is one manner in which we can improve in the future.
  
  As we increased the pressure in the bubble, the mastic tape started to lift up slightly from the inside towards the outside, and the leaking did
  seem to increase in volume. Ultimately, we were able to achieve about 3 1/2" of height over a diameter of about 28". The leak rate was such that
  we lost about 1/2"-3/4" in about 5 minutes without adding more air.
  Below are pictures of the first trial.

  ##Moving Forward
  
  The current plan is to try fiberglassing a small parabolic mirror on Monday the 15th following procedures similar to those described above.
  For the final version, I plan on designing cross sections of the mirror to serve as reinforcements. These will be arches sized to fit snuggly
  on the parabolic mirror. The final mirror will be about a meter or 36" in diameter.
