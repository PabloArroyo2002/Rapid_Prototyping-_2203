# Conclusion
  
## Creating the Concentrator Day 1
  On the first day of making the concentrator, we focused on attaching the circle of cut out MDF onto a flat piece of wood. We began by gluing
  the pieces onto the board using hot glue and then sprayed the surfaces that would be pressurized with polyurethane to prevent leaks through
  the MDF or pieces of wood on the bottom. To reduce the effects of breathing in the polyurethane, we performed the spraying in a fume hood.

  After applying three layers of polyurethane and waiting for it to dry, we read the SDS papers for the epoxy and hardener we would use to seal
  the mylar layer onto the first circle of MDF and later for the fiberglass. We all put on PPE, including eye protection, a Tyvek suit and 
  nitrile gloves taped onto the Tyvek suit. Justin mixed up the epoxy and hardener in the fume hood and we then poured a little bit of resin
  onto the rim of the MDF circle, which we spread out fairly evenly using popsicle sticks. Onto the rim we lowered the mylar, keeping it as 
  stretched out as possible, and then onto the mylar we placed the second ring of MDF with weight on top to hold the mylar in place.

After curing overnight the epoxy held down the epoxy but produced wrinkles along the rim, which remained through the end of the project. A likely
  solution is to apply a very thin layer of epoxy with something like a brush and to remove any excess that may fill the wrinkles. To facilitate future
  inflation, Justin drilled a small hole and inserted a 1/8" plastic tube that could be connected to the pressure regulator first shown in week 10.
  Below is an image after the mylar was trimmed.

## Creating the Concentrator Day 2
  To avoid cutting a hole in a table or a large piece of board, we experimented with placing down a rough circle of 3M mastic tape on a
  countertop. We cleaned the table with water and then hand sanitizer so that the tape could stick directly to a clean surface.
  We traced a 700c bicycle wheel as our guide. We left a small gap in the tape so we could insert a piece of 
  pneumatic tubing and then added tape on the sides and on top to ensure a proper seal with the mylar. With the pneumatic tape now secure
  we used a heat gun to soften the end that was outside the circle and then inserted a (presta) bicycle valve into the end, so that as the 
  tube cooled it would shrink tightly onto to the bicycle valve.

  ##Moving Forward
  
  The current plan is to try fiberglassing a small parabolic mirror on Monday the 15th following procedures similar to those described above.
  For the final version, I plan on designing cross sections of the mirror to serve as reinforcements. These will be arches sized to fit snuggly
  on the parabolic mirror. The final mirror will be about a meter or 36" in diameter.
