# Conclusion
  
## Creating the Concentrator Day 1
  On the first day of making the concentrator, we focused on attaching the circle of cut out MDF onto a flat piece of wood. We began by gluing
  the pieces onto the board using hot glue and then sprayed the surfaces that would be pressurized with polyurethane to prevent leaks through
  the MDF or pieces of wood on the bottom. To reduce the effects of breathing in the polyurethane, we performed the spraying in a fume hood.

  After applying three layers of polyurethane and waiting for it to dry, we read the SDS papers for the epoxy and hardener we would use to seal
  the mylar layer onto the first circle of MDF and later for the fiberglass. We all put on PPE, including eye protection, a Tyvek suit and 
  nitrile gloves taped onto the Tyvek suit. Justin mixed up the epoxy and hardener in the fume hood and we then poured a little bit of resin
  onto the rim of the MDF circle, which we spread out fairly evenly using popsicle sticks. Onto the rim we lowered the mylar, keeping it as 
  stretched out as possible, and then onto the mylar we placed the second ring of MDF with weight on top to hold the mylar in place.

After curing overnight the epoxy held down the epoxy but produced wrinkles along the rim, which remained through the end of the project. A likely
  solution is to apply a very thin layer of epoxy with something like a brush and to remove any excess that may fill the wrinkles. To facilitate future
  inflation, Justin drilled a small hole and inserted a 1/8" plastic tube that could be connected to the pressure regulator first shown in week 10.

## Preparation for Fiberglass Layup
  Given the downsides of working around epoxy, I cut out all the fiberglass pieces we were going to use prior to the layup phase. The first piece was a
  fiberglass veil, intended to preserver the smooth texture of the mylar without imprinting the weave of the fiberglass onto the surface. I then cut out
  three pieces of fiberglass cloth with the intention of using all of them to produce a high degree of structural stability.
   
## Creating the Concentrator Day 2
  Once the epoxy sealing the mylar was completely hardened, we inflated the mylar with the pressure regulator; however, the edges of the mylar began
  to lift up and we feared the mylar might detach from the MDF ring entirely.
  We decided to stop inflating the mylar any further and began to prepare the mylar sheet for the epoxy and fiberglass application. I attempted to clean
  the surface with 91% rubbing alcohol and found the orange coloring on the mylar coming off. I stopped cleaning and we began to wet out the fiberglass
  veil with epoxy. Compared to burlap, the fiberglass was much less absorbent and also proved to be easier to place flat onto the mylar, despite the fact
  that the mylar was now inflated. Adding the fiberglass cloth was about as easy as the veil. Like the isopropyl alcohol, the epoxy began to dissolve the
  orange coating on the mylar, giving the fiberglass a funny orange color. Despite the added weight of the fiberglass, the mylar continued
  to lift up so we decided to add put the second MDF ring on permanently and used a nail gun to hold it down in place. This proved a smart move as the ring 
  prevented any further detatchment and added a constraint on the mylar's expansion under pressure. Finally, we added a second piece of fiberglass cloth and
  added the remaining epoxy to the outer edge of the mylar, to create a good seal with the second MDF ring.

  When the epoxy had cured, Justin trimmed the fiberglass edges with a box cutter and a heat gun.

## Minor Modifications for Assembly
  To enable the reflector to effectively heat the thermal battery, I cut out a 4" diameter hole in the middle of the reflector with a razor blade. This was 
  slightly problematic as this was effectively like removing the middle of an arch, compromising the rigidity of the whole curved surface. Furthermore, the 
  mylar and fiberglass were beginning to separate slightly where I cut the hole. Duct tape would not adhere to the epoxy surface, so I had to create a ring of
  duct tape around the cut out hole and then connected it to the wooden rim of the dish. Applying epoxy to the edge of the hole and then reinforcing it with
  more fiberglass may be a better and more permanent solution for a finished product. We then drilled three holes for steel rods, rods that would hold the 
  retroreflector near the focal point to send the light back onto the thermal battery behind the reflector. We threaded the rods so that a screw could hold them
  in place on the rim of the reflector. The retroreflector was 3D printed and designed for a 37" focal distance to make it compatible with Joseph's multi-surface
  reflector. On either side of the platform holding the retroreflector we added tubing with a set screw so we can fine tune the distance and angle.
  
## Testing
  Given the threat of the mylar detaching from the bottom ring as we inflated it, we were not able to inflate the mylar to a precise height, so Joel and I
  had to determine the focal point of the reflector empirically. Given that the focal point of a reflector is determined by the distance of the light source,
  assuming that the light is not columnated, Joel and I used a Milwakee spotlight and moved the reflector as far as we could and then focused the light onto
  a piece of paper. The distance from the hole in the reflector to the site of maximum concentration was 33", and subtracting  the depth of the dish we
   determined that the focal distance from the front of the reflector was 31 1/4".
  
  Having determined the distance at which the light is focused, we attached the platform with the retroreflector to the three steel rods meant to hold it in place.
  Again, we used the spotlight to try to find the proper location for the retroreflector; however, the spotlight seemed to not be the ideal tool, and using 
  sunlight would likely be better, although great precaution must be employed to prevent blinding yourself. The light was making it onto the retroreflector, but
  it seems that the quality was not good enough to bounce a perceptible amount of light back through the center of the dish.
