 ## First Attempt With Bike Rim
  
  For the first attempt at creating a parabolic mirror, we began with the same setup as on the first trial during week 7. Instead of inserting the pneumatic
  tubing into the mastic tape line, I attached the tube from a pen onto the pneumatic tubing to reduce the diameter of the piece in the mastic tape and 
  this did seem to help create a better seal. To further reduce leaks and to increase the amount of pressure between the mylar film and the table, we clamped
  down a bike rim onto the mastic tape circle, and this prevented the mastic tape from lifting up.

  Given the aid of the bike rim and a more precise mastic tape circle, we achieved a more mirror-like surface with the wrinkles extending no more than two or 
  three inches into the the now inflated mylar. We then mixed the epoxy we had at hand (more on this later) and applied it onto burlap fabric. The burlap 
  proved to be a suboptimal fiber, despite it's cheap price and environmental benefits over fiberglass or carbon fiber, because it absorbed a lot more epoxy
  than fiberglass or carbon fiber would. The burlap also proved to be difficult to conform to the curved shape of the mylar. The lack of compliance combined
  with a slow leak resulted in poor adherence between the mylar and burlap, resulting in a very non-parabolic or spherical shape.

 ###Epoxy Issues
 The epoxy we had on hand was Total Boat Brand and was not clearly labelled as to the appropriate mixing ratio of hardener to the resin. Besides the issues
  with the proportions of the two components, the "crystal clear" hardener is unecessarily toxic and provides no performance gain, so we will be ordering 
  from a different supplier in the future.
  
 An epoxy with a short curing time would be ideal but given shortages of one of the components for the fast curing hardener, we will go for a medium cure
 time to ensure we can get the materials we need on time. We are going for a short cure time since we don't need a longer cure and so we can iterate more 
 quickly.
 
 ## Trial 2 - Pressure regulator
  Given the fact that we can not prevent leaks entirely, we are going to use a pressure regulator to constantly feed a given pressure so that the bubble under
  the mylar doesn't shrink as the epoxy cures.
  
     <p style="text-align:center;"><img src=

  We were able to achieve promising amount of inflation without having the bicycle rim clamped down; however, as the mastic began to move inward, the wrinkles
  around the edge of the bubble grew. It became clear that having the mastic tape contact the mylar directly won't produce the kind of reflective surface we 
  want.

  ## Moving Forward
 
  The plan moving forward is to create a two-layered ring out of laser cut MDF. The first layer will attache to the mastic tape, preventing the tape from
   shifting as the mylar tries to move inward. The mylar sheet will then be epoxied or glued to this first layer. Next, we attach the second ring on top,
   creating a sandwhich of MDF with the mylar in the middle. The idea behind having a rigid edge to the reflector is to prevent warping and to create a 
  surface that is easier to connect to the secondary mirror and to the stand that will hold it.
  
  Lasercutting the shape needed proved to be challenging, but I learned that I don't need to create a DXF file when using the Beaver Works laser cutter
  and that I should instead just project onto a plane, which I then turn into a pdf via the "Drawing" workspace.
  
  The laser cutting went without much trouble, but a band saw will be necessary, as I was not able to fit all the pieces on a 23" x 36" space, which
  was what the laser cutter and piece of MDF that we had limited me to.
  
  Below are pictures of the cutting and also how I plan on assembling the pieces into a ring.
