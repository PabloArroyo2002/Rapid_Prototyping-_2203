 ## First Attempt With Bike Rim
  
  For the first attempt at creating a parabolic mirror, we began with the same setup as on the first trial during week 7. Instead of inserting the pneumatic
  tubing into the mastic tape line, I attached the tube from a pen onto the pneumatic tubing to reduce the diameter of the piece in the mastic tape and 
  this did seem to help create a better seal. To further reduce leaks and to increase the amount of pressure between the mylar film and the table, we clamped
  down a bike rim onto the mastic tape circle, and this prevented the mastic tape from lifting up.

  Given the aid of the bike rim and a more precise mastic tape circle, we achieved a more mirror-like surface with the wrinkles extending no more than two or 
  three inches into the the now inflated mylar. We then mixed the epoxy we had at hand (more on this later) and applied it onto burlap fabric. The burlap 
  proved to be a suboptimal fiber, despite it's cheap price and environmental benefits over fiberglass or carbon fiber, because it absorbed a lot more epoxy
  than fiberglass or carbon fiber would. The burlap also proved to be difficult to conform to the curved shape of the mylar. The lack of compliance combined
  with a slow leak resulted in poor adherence between the mylar and burlap, resulting in a very non-parabolic or spherical shape.
