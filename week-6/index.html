## Calculations
  
I used real world numbers for the maximum magnification of a fresnel lens (~800x) and then took the highest heat achieved, around
1300k. Given a starting area of around a square meter, this means that there were roughly 25 square centimeters that were at this 
maximum temperature. Since the temperature is inversely propotional to area, I calculated that somewhere between 56 and 113 square
 centimeters can be heated to the temperature needed to melt our eutectic mixture, for every square meter of collection we have.
With the thermal storage container having a length of 15 cm in the shortest direction, it appears that any side can be heated,
  even if we have 4 square meters of collection. This is because 15 cm by 15 cm grants us an area of 225 square centimeters, and 
  going with a smaller area will ensure that the pellets melt more quickly. We should not heat the top of the container, as this
  space will likely have air underneath the steel, with the molten mass lying as low as possible. Heating a side or the bottom seems
  to be the smartest option as the heat will also want to rise into the rest of the material and will accelerate heating through
  convection.

 ## Design
  
  The drawings show how we can use mirrors to direct energy conveniently from the top, occupying less ground area and providing shade for the cooks.
  The first drawing illustration shows the benefit of heating the material from the bottom.
