## Calculations

Microwaving a steak takes 5-7 minutes, and the mircowave emits 1kW of power, so we get between 300 and 420 kW seconds,
translating to .3 MJ to .42 MJ to microwave the steak. I used these real world numbers as they account for some heat
losses and inefficiency, although I am not sure if direct mircowave radiation may be more efficient than conduction.
Additionally, the microwave contains most of the heat since it is a closed container. This math was done based on 
[***this***](https://www.businessinsider.com/yes-you-can-microwave-a-steak-heres-how-2016-6)
Business Insider article describing the microwaving of a one inch thick steak. 

The amount of energy needed to heat one liter of water from 20 to 100 degrees Celsius is .183 kWh or .659 MJ. 
Thus boiling a liter of water and preparing a steak requires about 1 MJ of energy. Heating up tomatoes requires almost
exactly the same amount of energy as water since they are 95% water, and that yields a high estimate as water has the 
highest specific heat of any liquid.

Assuming we want to cook the steak, as decribed in the Business Insider article, boil a liter of water, and then prepare
a kilogram of tomato and rice (combined kilogram), we expect to need about 2MJ of energy worth of heat. Assuming approximately
30% efficiency, we need about 6MJ of total energy stored.

The first PDF attached to the design section shows my calculations for the amounts space and mass needed to store the energy 
necessary to safely store enough energy for the cooking described in the above paragraph.

Using CaO --> Ca(OH)2 we need 1.5 liters (1.5kg) of water and 1.25L (4kg) of CaO, giving at least 30% overhead on the material
requirements. This corresponds to 3 mm of space needed underneath the cooking surface to store the CaO and water. The cost
of this much CaO is about ***$30***.

Perhaps a safer alternative is to use Erythritol (C4H10O4) as a means of phase change storage. This would require 25kg, or about
17L of C4H10O4, with a similar margin to that of the CaO. Accounting for maximum thermal expansion of about 16%, we get that 
2.25cm of space are needed below the cooking surface to store the Erythritol. The total cost of this is around ***$310***.




## Designs
This first image shows most of the calculations mentioned under the calculations section and shows a sketch of how a system can 
be isolated from its environment while still being able to tolerate pressure changes.

This image contains an example of how the range of heats can be controlled by adjusting the size of the conducting and insulating
parts. This image also shows how the different compounds correspond to slightly different designs and space requirements.

The final sketch shows how capture, storage, and cooking can work together and is one of many designs I hope to help integrate into reality.
